# This is a demo of the Bilingual Families Project's online Word learning study (TabletSwitch).
In this task we are investigating bilingual toddlers’ learning of cross-language synonyms (i.e., translation equivalents) in immediate translated sentences versus single language sentences.

Bilingual toddlers’ word learning will be assessed with an online asynchronous experiment. The design uses repeated measures, with condition (Immediate Translation condition vs. One-Language-At-A-Time condition) as within-subjects factor. Children will be taught and tested on four novel word-object pairings; half of the pairings will occur in immediate translated sentences (i.e., Immediate Translation condition) and half will occur in single language sentences (i.e., One-Language-At-A-Time condition). The experiment will be divided in two blocks, blocked by condition with the block order counterbalanced across participants.

## Demo details
In this demo, we'll be showing you the experiment testing English-French word-learning performance in the _"English first, one-language-at-a-time first"_ condition.
